Engagement Letter App for Lawyers

The webapp lets to the lawyers write a engagement letter to charge to their clients, also, the lawyers can draw and upload their signature
directly in the app and send the engagement letter signed to the email of the client, linking the url of the digital letter and then
with the API of Stripe I add the feature of pay the letter from the webapp to validate the letter. It were a complex project but I achieve
launch the first version and tried with a firm of lawyers. :)
